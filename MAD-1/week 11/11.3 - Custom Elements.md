1. **Introduction to JavaScript's Role:**
   - JavaScript is introduced as a key element in modern application development.
   - The need for JavaScript arises when defining custom elements in the context of HTML.

2. **Custom Elements in HTML5:**
   - HTML5 has specific requirements for elements like title and h1.
   - The desire to create arbitrary custom elements, like "my-button," prompts the use of JavaScript.
```
   // Example: Creating a simple custom element
    class MyComponent extends HTMLElement {
        connectedCallback() {
            this.innerHTML = "Hello, World!";
        }
    }

    customElements.define("my-component", MyComponent);
```

3. **Challenges with Custom Element Naming:**
   - Discussion on the ambiguity of defining custom elements like "my-button."
   - Lack of clarity on the browser's interpretation of such custom elements.

4. **Custom Element Characteristics:**
   - Explanation of how custom elements can have their own states.
   - Introduction to the concept of defining the display and functionality of custom elements.

5. **Web Component Definition:**
   - The lecture introduces the concept of web components.
   - Web components encompass custom elements, the Shadow DOM, and HTML templates for easier use.
   - Checkout [MDN Web Doc Examples](https://github.com/mdn/web-components-examples)
   ```// Example: Web component definition with Shadow DOM and HTML Template
    class MyComponent extends HTMLElement {
        constructor() {
            super();
            const shadow = this.attachShadow({ mode: "open" });
            shadow.innerHTML = `
            <style>
                /* Styles specific to this component */
            </style>
            <div>
                <!-- HTML template -->
            </div>
            `;
        }
    }

    customElements.define("my-component", MyComponent);
    ```

6. **Shadow DOM Explanation:**
   - Overview of the Shadow DOM as a means of encapsulating styling for a specific component.
   - The demonstration shows how styles applied to one component don't affect others.
   - Shadow DOM is used to keep styling of component separate from rest of the page.

7. **HTML Templates:**
   - Introduction to HTML templates, allowing flexible content replacement.
   - Example demonstrates changing the template to modify the displayed content.
   - `<template>` and `<slot>` HTML5 elements are used to create a markup template

8. **Live Examples and CodePen:**
   - The lecturer points to csstricks.com for live examples and experimentation.
   - Demonstrates the use of CodePen to visualize HTML, CSS, and JavaScript output.

9. **GitHub and MDN Examples:**
   - Reference to the Mozilla Developer Network's GitHub page with various web component examples.
   - Explanation of a practical example involving a word count component.

10. **Word Count Component Example:**
    - Explanation of the JavaScript class defining a word count component.
    - Demonstration of the word count component dynamically updating as text is typed.
    - [MDN Implementation in JS](https://github.com/mdn/web-components-examples/tree/main/word-count-web-component)
    - [Live Site Preview](https://mdn.github.io/web-components-examples/word-count-web-component/)

11. **Reuse and Reusability:**
    - Emphasis on web components as reusable UI elements.
    - The advantage of creating components that can be easily shared, installed, and referenced.

12. **Standardization Challenges:**
    - Acknowledgment of the non-standardized nature of web components.
    - Subjectivity in using Shadow DOM and templates may lead to varying interpretations.

13. **Conclusion:**
    - Recap of the primary goals of web components: extending HTML5 elements, using the Shadow DOM, and employing templates for reusability.
    - Acknowledgment of potential challenges in standardization and subjective interpretations.
