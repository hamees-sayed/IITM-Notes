1. **Introduction to Services Approach:**
   - The services approach suggests specialization rather than a single person handling all aspects of application deployment.
   - Datacenter operators specialize in infrastructure, focusing on physical computers, power, network, and security.
   - Developers can then concentrate on app development, assuming that infrastructure is taken care of.

2. **Software-as-a-Service (SaaS):**
   - SaaS is a cloud computing service model that allows users to access software over the internet without installing it on their own computer.
   - Examples include Google Docs, Gmail, Microsoft Office 365, and content management systems like Drupal and WordPress.
   - Users leverage software without installing or managing it locally. Hosted solutions simplify access.

3. **Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS):**
   - Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) is a cloud computing service that provides on-demand storage, networking, and compute resources.
   - Providers offer virtual machines or physical machines in a datacenter.
   - Users manage the operating system, security, software updates, etc. IaaS gives more control but requires more responsibility.
   - Examples include AWS, Google Compute Engine, Azure, DigitalOcean, and Linode.

4. **Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS):**
   - Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) is a cloud computing model that provides a complete cloud platform for developing, running, and managing applications. 
   - Combines hardware and software as a platform for specific development needs.
   - Providers manage infrastructure, OS installation, security patches, and offer a base application platform.
   - Developers focus on managing application code, specifying server size, and database connectivity.
   - Examples of PaaS providers include Replit and Glitch.

5. **Replit Example:**
   - Replit provides a development environment where users can write and run code.
   - It offers Infrastructure-as-a-Service for development purposes.
   - Replit automatically provisions resources (e.g., 4 CPUs and 26 GB RAM) but focuses more on education and development than long-term deployment.

6. **Glitch Example:**
   - Glitch is similar to Replit but with a focus on sharing development and initial deployment.
   - It provides a development environment with Linux-based resources (e.g., 4 CPUs and 6 GB RAM) and additional features for app deployment.
   - Glitch is exploring options for keeping apps always on, making it a potential platform for hosting.

7. **Comparing Replit and Glitch:**
   - Replit emphasizes development and education, while Glitch emphasizes sharing development and initial deployment.
   - Both provide an integrated platform for development, including a file manager, code editor, and console.

8. **Development and Deployment with Replit:**
   - Replit is suited for educational purposes and short-term development.
   - Shared resources mean that apps may shut down after some idle time.

9. **Development and Deployment with Glitch:**
   - Glitch caters to developers with a focus on sharing initial app development.
   - It provides a platform for more extended development and potential deployment.

10. **PaaS Considerations:**
    - PaaS simplifies development but may have limitations on scalability and long-term deployment.
    - Users should consider the specific requirements and goals when choosing between IaaS and PaaS.

11. **Conclusion:**
    - Choosing between IaaS and PaaS depends on the level of control and responsibility desired.
    - Developers should explore various platforms, understand their offerings, and align them with project requirements.
