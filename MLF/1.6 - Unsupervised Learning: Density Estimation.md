# Density Estimation  
Density estimation in unsupervised learning is the process of estimating the probability density function (PDF) of a dataset, which describes how data points are distributed across different values or regions in the feature space.   

It's a way to understand the underlying patterns or structure within the data without any predefined labels or categories. Density estimation is particularly useful for clustering, anomaly detection, and generating new data points.  

It is a Probabilistic Algorithm and the output is in the range $[0, 1]$.

- Data: $\{\textbf{x}^1, \textbf{x}^2, \dots , \textbf{x}^n\}$
- $\textbf{x}^i \in \mathbb{R}^d$
- Probability Mapping $P: \mathbb{R}^d \rightarrow \mathbb{R}_+$ that sums to $1$.  
- Goal : $P(\textbf{x})$ is large if $\textbf{x} \in Data$, and low otherwise.  
- $Loss = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n - log(P(\textbf{x}^i))$, also known as Negative Log Likelihood.

## Example Use Case  

**Problem:** Assume that you're working for a cybersecurity firm and have the task of identifying potential security threats or breaches within your network system. The network data obtained usually consists of various data points that record typical user behavior. On rare occasions, there might be unusual behavior, such as a potential cyber attack.  

Detect anomalies or unusual behavior in a computer network system indicating potential threats or security breaches.


**Approach:** Density estimation can be used to model the distribution of user behaviour and identify unusual behaviour that deviate significantly from this distribution as potential security threat. Here's how it can be applied:

1. **Data Collection:** Collect a dataset of regular network behavior. The idea here is to capture a broad range of 'normal' activity.

2. **Data Preprocessing:** After data collection, apply a density estimation algorithm, such as a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) or Kernel Density Estimation (KDE).

3. **Density Estimation:** These models will study the collected data and learn to estimate the probability density function of the input data. They generate a model representing areas of 'high density' or 'normal behavior', and areas where data points are found less frequently are 'low density'.

4. **Threshold Setting:** New data points are then gathered from the network system, and their densities are evaluated using the estimated model. If the densities are low (i.e., data points are found in low-density regions), it suggests these points are anomalous.

5. **Fraud Detection:** These anomalies can be flagged as potential threats or security breaches for further investigation.

6. **Alerts and Investigation:** Regularly update the model to reflect the changing patterns of 'normal behavior'.
  

By applying unsupervised learning density estimation, one can identify potential threats without specifying what a threat looks like beforehand, which is beneficial in real-world situations where new kinds of threats are continually emerging.
