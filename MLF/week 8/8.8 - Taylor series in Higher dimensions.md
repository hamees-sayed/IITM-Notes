# Taylor series in Higher dimensions  

$f(x+\eta d) = f(x) + \eta d f'(x) + \eta^2 \frac{d^2}{2} f''(x)+ \dots$  

Higher order Taylor series (they are in vector form):  

$$\vec{x}_{t+1} = \vec{x}_t + \overrightarrow{\eta(-\nabla f(x_t))}$$  

$"-\nabla f(x)"$ is not the only direction but it gives the $steepest$ descent.
