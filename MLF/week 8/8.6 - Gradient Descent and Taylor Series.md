# Update Rule  

$x_{t+1} = x_t + \eta_t(-f'(x))$  

What's so special about $-f'(x)$?  

Previously we talked about choosing a direction in the general form of update rule. Now we'll discuss the reasoning for choosing that specific direction.  

# Taylor Series  
$f(x+\eta d) = f(x) + \eta df'(x) + \eta^2 \frac{d^2}{2}f''(x)+\dots$  
Using taylor seris we can learn about the function $\forall \space x$  

In the equation:  
1. $\eta$ is very small (0.1, 0.01).  
2. $d$ is the direction.  
3. $\eta^2 \frac{d^2}{2}f''(x)+\dots$ are higher order terms very close to zero.  
4. For small enough $\eta$  
$f(x+\eta d) \approx f(x) + \eta df'(x)$  
$f(x+\eta d) - f(x) \approx \eta df'(x)$   

$f(x+\eta d)$ is the function evaluation at updated point along the direction $d$.  
$f(x)$ is the function evaluation at the current point $x$. 

$\rightarrow$ Want to choose the direction $d$ such that: $f(x+\eta d) - f(x) < 0$
