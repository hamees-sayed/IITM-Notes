# Introduction to Convexity

1. **Motivation for Convexity in Optimization:**
   - Important for optimization problems in machine learning and data science.
   - Aims to find global minima or maxima in optimization.

2. **Brief Introduction to Convexity:**
   - Convexity is a crucial concept for optimization.
   - Key in certain classes of functions, especially convex functions.

3. **Definition of Convex Sets:**
   - Consider a set $S$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$.
   - $S$ is convex if, for any $x_1, x_2$ in $S$ and $\lambda \in [0, 1]$, $\lambda x_1 + (1-\lambda)x_2 \in S$.

4. **Visualizing Convex Sets:**
   - Convex sets: Examples include intervals, circles, and hyperplanes.
   - Non-convex sets: Examples include disjoint intervals.

5. **Example of Convex Set: Hyperplanes:**
   - Definition of a hyperplane: $W^Tx = b$.
   - Hyperplanes are convex sets.
   - Proof: For $x_1, x_2$ in $S$, show $\lambda x_1 + (1-\lambda)x_2 \in S$.

6. **Exercise: Proving Convexity of Half Spaces:**
   - Half spaces: Defined as $\{x \in \mathbb{R}^d \mid W^Tx \leq b\}$.
   - Exercise: Prove that half spaces are convex sets.

7. **Conclusion:**
   - Understanding convexity is crucial for optimization.
   - Convex sets play a significant role in machine learning applications.



This concludes the brief introduction to convexity, highlighting its importance and providing examples of convex and non-convex sets.
