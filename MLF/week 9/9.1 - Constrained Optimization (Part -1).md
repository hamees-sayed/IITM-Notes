# Constrained Optimization

1. **Problem Setup:**
   - The optimization problem being considered involves minimizing a function $f(x)$ subject to a constraint $g(x) \leq 0$.
   - The goal is to find the optimal solution $x^{\ast}$ that minimizes $f(x)$ while satisfying the constraint.

2. **Necessary Conditions for Optimality:**
   - The first necessary condition discussed is that the constraint $g(x^{\ast}) \leq 0$ must be satisfied for $x^{\ast}$ to be a potential optimal solution.
   - However, checking this condition alone is not sufficient.

3. **Descent Directions and Feasible Directions:**
   - Descent direction: A direction in which the function $f(x)$ decreases.
   - Feasible direction: A direction in which the constraint $g(x)$ is still satisfied.
   - Descent directions are related to the function $f(x)$, while feasible directions are related to the constraint $g(x)$.

4. **No Descent Direction Should be Feasible:**
   - The key idea is that, for a point $x^{\ast}$ to be optimal, there should be no direction in which both $f(x)$ decreases (descent direction) and $g(x)$ is still satisfied (feasible direction).
   - If such a direction exists, it implies that $x^{\ast}$ is not optimal because one could move to a new point with lower $f(x)$ and still satisfy the constraint $g(x) \leq 0$.

5. **Formalizing the Idea:**
   - Descent directions for $f$ are determined by the gradient $\nabla f(x)$.
   - Feasible directions for $g$ are determined by the gradient $\nabla g(x)$.
   - The condition "no descent direction should be feasible" is mathematically expressed as $\nabla f(x^{\ast})^T d < 0$ for any feasible direction $d$.

6. **Visualization:**
   - The lecture uses visual aids to help understand the relationship between descent and feasible directions.
   - Descent directions for $f$ are depicted as directions where the function decreases.
   - Feasible directions for $g$ are depicted as directions in which the constraint is still satisfied.
   - The goal is to show that, if $x^{\ast}$ is optimal, there should be no direction that simultaneously satisfies both conditions.

7. **Conclusion:**
   - The conclusion is that the relationship between the gradients $\nabla f(x)$ and $\nabla g(x)$ plays a crucial role in determining whether a given point $x^{\ast}$ is optimal.

Overall, the lecture introduces the concept of necessary conditions for optimality in constrained optimization problems and emphasizes the importance of the relationship between descent and feasible directions.
