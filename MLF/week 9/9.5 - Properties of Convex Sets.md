# Properties of Convex Sets

**Introduction:**
- Convexity is a crucial concept in optimization.
- Convex sets play a significant role in various applications, especially in machine learning and data science.

**Property of Convex Sets: Intersection of Convex Sets**
- The intersection of convex sets is itself a convex set.
- Let $S_1$ and $S_2$ be convex sets in $\mathbb{R}^d$, and let $S_{1 \cap 2}$ be their intersection.
- To prove convexity, consider two points $x_1$ and $x_2$ in $S_{1 \cap 2}$ and show that $\lambda x_1 + (1-\lambda)x_2$ is also in $S_{1 \cap 2}$.
- Convexity of $x_1$ and $x_2$ ensures that $\lambda x_1 + (1-\lambda)x_2$ belongs to both $S_1$ and $S_2$.
- Therefore, the intersection of convex sets is convex.

**Examples:**
1. **Convex Set Example:** Circle or Ellipse
   - A circle is a convex set as any two points within it form a line segment that lies entirely within the circle.

2. **Non-Convex Set Example:** Disjoint Intervals
   - Disjoint intervals are non-convex sets, as the line segment between points in different intervals may extend outside the set.

3. **Hyperplanes as Convex Sets:**
   - Definition: $W^Tx = b$, where $W$ is a vector and $b$ is a constant.
   - Hyperplanes are convex sets, as any convex combination of points on the hyperplane remains on the hyperplane.

4. **Convexity of Half Spaces:**
   - Definition: $\{x \in \mathbb{R}^d \mid W^Tx \leq b\}$.
   - Exercise: Prove that half spaces are convex sets.

**Convex Hulls:**
- Convex combinations are expressed as $z = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \lambda_i x_i$ where $\lambda_i > 0$ and $\sum_{i=1}^{n} \lambda_i = 1$.
- The convex hull of a set $S$ is the set of all points expressible as convex combinations of points in $S$.
- Exercise: Prove that the convex hull of a set is convex.

**Convex Hulls as Intersection of Convex Sets:**
- Convex hulls can be defined as the intersection of all convex sets containing the given points.
- Exercise: Show the equivalence of the two definitions of convex hulls.

**Examples of Convex Sets:**
1. **Linear Systems of Equations:**
   - The set of solutions to $Ax = b$ (where $A$ is an $m \times d$ matrix) is convex.
   - Proven by showing it is the intersection of convex sets (solutions to individual linear equations).

2. **Balls in $\mathbb{R}^d$:**
   - The set of points within a Euclidean ball ($\|x\| \leq \theta$) is convex.
   - Exercise: Prove that the ball is convex.

**Conclusion:**
- Understanding convexity and convex sets is fundamental for optimization and has various applications in different domains.
- Convexity simplifies the analysis of sets and helps in proving the convexity of complex sets by considering their intersection with simpler convex sets.
