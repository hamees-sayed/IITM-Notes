# Properties of Convex Functions  

**Convex Functions and Local Minima**

A local minimum of a function is a point where the function value is less than or equal to all other function values in a small neighborhood around the point. A global minimum of a function is a point where the function value is less than or equal to all other function values in the entire domain of the function. A convex function is a function where the line segment connecting any two points on the graph of the function is always on or above the graph of the function.

**Theorem:** Every local minimum of a convex function is also a global minimum.

**Proof:**

1. Assume that there exists a local minimum of a convex function that is not a global minimum.
2. Let $x^{\ast}$ be the local minimum and $z$ be the global minimum.
3. Since $z$ is the global minimum, $f(z) < f(x^{\ast})$.
4. Since $x^{\ast}$ is a local minimum, there exists a $\delta > 0$ such that $f(y) ≥ f(x^{\ast})$ for all $y$ within the $\delta$-ball around $x^{\ast}$.
5. Let $\lambda$ be a number between 0 and 1.
6. By convexity of $f$, $f(\lambda x^{\ast} + (1 - \lambda) z) ≤ \lambda f(x^{\ast}) + (1 - \lambda) f(z)$.
7. Since $f(z) < f(x^{\ast})$, $f(\lambda x^{\ast} + (1 - \lambda) z) < \lambda f(x^{\ast}) + (1 - \lambda) f(x^{\ast})$.
8. Substituting $f(x^{\ast})$ for $\lambda f(x^{\ast}) + (1 - \lambda) f(x^{\ast})$, we get $f(\lambda x^{\ast} + (1 - \lambda) z) < f(x^{\ast})$.
9. This contradicts the assumption that $x^{\ast}$ is a local minimum.
10. Therefore, every local minimum of a convex function is also a global minimum.

**Implications:**

* If a function is convex, then any algorithm that finds a local minimum is guaranteed to find the global minimum.
* Gradient descent is an algorithm that is guaranteed to find a local minimum of any function.
* Therefore, gradient descent is guaranteed to find the global minimum of any convex function.  

## Finding Minimum and Maximum Points  
**Step 1:** List the objective function $f(x)$ and $g(x)$.  
**Step 2:** Solve $\nabla f(x,y,z) = \lambda \nabla g(x, y, z)$ to get values of $x$, $y$ and $z$ in terms of $\lambda$.  
**Step 3:** Substitute these values in $g(x)$ to find critical points.
