# Linear Approximation of Mutlivariate Function 
**Gradient Interpretations:** The lecture discussed several interpretations of the gradient, which is a vector containing the partial derivatives of a multivariable function. These interpretations include:

1. **Computational Interpretation:** The gradient is a vector that contains all the partial derivatives of the function with respect to its variables.  

2. **Linear Approximation Interpretation:** The gradient helps in linearly approximating the function's change around a point.  

3. **Tangent Plane Interpretation:** The gradient defines a plane tangent to the graph of the function at a given point.  

3. **Direction of Steepest Ascent:** The gradient points in the direction of the steepest increase of the function at a specific point.


## Linear Approximation:
for $\textbf{v} \in \mathbb{R}^d, \space \textbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^d$  
$f(x) \approx f(\textbf{v}) + \nabla f(\textbf{v})^\text{T}(\textbf{x}-\textbf{v})$

**Illustration:**  
$f: \mathbb{R}^2 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$  
$f(x_1, x_2) \approx f(v_1, v_2) + \nabla f(v_1, v_2)(x_i - v_i)$  

**Example:**  
$\text{Approximate} \space f(x_1, x_2) = x_1^2 + x_2^2 \space \text{around} \space (6, 2).$  
$f(v_1, v_2) = 40,$ $\nabla f(v_1) = [12, 4]$  
$f(x_1, x_2) \approx 40 + [12, 4]\cdot[x_1 - 6, x_2 - 2]^\text{T}$  
$f(x_1, x_2) \approx 12x_1 + 4x_2 - 40$  

- **Tangent Plane:** The graph of the linear approximation is a plane that touches the graph of the function at the point v, and it helps approximate the function locally.

- **Contour Sets:** The gradient is perpendicular to the contour sets of the function. Contour sets represent the points where the function has the same value. Gradient of a function $\nabla f(x)$ points in the direction of the steepest ascent and $-\nabla f(x)$. i.e., the negative gradient points in the direction of steepest descent.    

- **Directional Derivative:** The directional derivative of a function $f$ at a point $v$ along the direction $u$ is given by grad $D_u[f](v)$. It quantifies the rate of change of the function as you move from $v$ along $u$.

- **Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality:** The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality provides bounds for the dot product of two vectors, and it is useful for understanding the relationship between the gradient and direction vectors.  
$-||a||\cdot||b|| \leq a^Tb \leq ||a||\cdot||b||$

- **Descent Directions:** The set of descent directions for a function $f$ at a point $v$ is the set of directions along which the function decreases. It is defined by $\nabla f(v)áµ€u < 0$.

- **Critical Points:** Critical points are points where the gradient of the function is zero, i.e., $\nabla f(v) = 0$. They can be candidates for minima, maxima, or saddle points, but further analysis is required to determine their nature.
