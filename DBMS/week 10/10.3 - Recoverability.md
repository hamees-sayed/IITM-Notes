# Recoverability

Certainly! Let's break down the lecture transcript and elaborate on each section for a more detailed explanation.

### 1. **Introduction to Transactions:**
   - The lecture begins by highlighting the challenges that arise when multiple transactions operate simultaneously on the same data items.
   - Two essential forms of serializability are introduced: conflict serializability and view serializability.
   - The concept of an acyclic precedence graph is explained, emphasizing its role in ensuring conflict serializability.

### 2. **Module Objectives:**
   - The module aims to address issues related to transaction failures due to system issues (recoverability).
   - Focus on view serializability as a weaker form of serializability, which guarantees the serializability of more schedules than conflict serializability.

### 3. **Recoverable Schedules:**
   - Recoverability refers to the ability to bring the database to a consistent state even if a transaction fails due to system failure.
   - The importance of ensuring that the commit of a writing transaction precedes the commit of a reading transaction to maintain consistency.
   - Recoverable schedules in a database refer to the ability to restore a consistent state even if a transaction fails. A schedule is recoverable if, when one transaction reads data written by another transaction, the committing transaction must have committed before the reading transaction starts. This ensures that if the writing transaction fails, the reading transaction can be rolled back to maintain consistency.  

    Example: Transaction T1 writes data A, and then T2 reads A. For recoverability, T1 must commit before T2 starts. If T1 fails after writing A, it can be rolled back, and T2 won't be affected, maintaining recoverability.

### 4. **Cascadeless Schedules:**
   Cascadeless schedules in database management systems are schedules that avoid the cascading effect of rollbacks. In a cascadeless schedule, if a transaction fails and needs to be rolled back, it does not force the rollback of other transactions that have already committed.

To achieve cascadelessness, the following condition must be met:

- If a transaction $T_i$ reads a data item previously written by another transaction $T_j$, the commit operation of $T_j$ must precede the read operation of $T_i$.

This condition ensures that the reading transactions are not dependent on the transactions that subsequently fail. In other words, the rollback of a transaction does not trigger the rollback of others that have already successfully committed.

Cascadeless schedules are desirable to prevent a chain reaction of rollbacks, minimizing the impact of failures on other transactions.

### 5. **Transaction Control Language (TCL):**
   Transaction Control Language (TCL) is a subset of SQL (Structured Query Language) that deals specifically with the management of transactions within a relational database. TCL consists of a set of commands that enable users to control and manage transactions, ensuring the atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability (ACID properties) of database transactions. Here are the primary TCL commands:

1. **COMMIT:**
   - **Purpose:** Commits the current transaction, making all the changes made during the transaction permanent.
   - **Usage:** `COMMIT;`
   - **Note:** If the transaction is successful, COMMIT finalizes the changes. If there are any issues, a ROLLBACK command might be used to undo the changes.

2. **ROLLBACK:**
   - **Purpose:** Rolls back the current transaction, undoing any changes made during the transaction.
   - **Usage:** `ROLLBACK;`
   - **Note:** ROLLBACK is used to revert the changes made within a transaction if an error or issue occurs. It brings the database back to its state before the transaction began.

3. **SAVEPOINT:**
   - **Purpose:** Sets a point within a transaction to which you can later roll back.
   - **Usage:** `SAVEPOINT savepoint_name;`
   - **ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT:** Rolls back to the specified savepoint.
     - **Usage:** `ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT savepoint_name;`
   - **RELEASE SAVEPOINT:** Removes a savepoint.
     - **Usage:** `RELEASE SAVEPOINT savepoint_name;`
   - **Note:** SAVEPOINT is useful for creating intermediate points within a transaction, allowing you to selectively roll back to these points.

4. **SET TRANSACTION:**
   - **Purpose:** Initiates a new transaction and can set various transaction characteristics.
   - **Usage:** 
     - `SET TRANSACTION [ READ WRITE | READ ONLY ];`
     - `SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL { SERIALIZABLE | REPEATABLE READ | READ COMMITTED | READ UNCOMMITTED };`
   - **Note:** It allows users to specify whether the transaction is read-only or read-write and set the isolation level for the transaction.

### 6. **View Serializability:**  
View serializability is a concept in databases that relaxes the strictness of transaction order. It ensures that even with different transaction timings, the end result or "view" of the database remains consistent. Unlike rigid ordering, it allows flexibility in how transactions occur while still maintaining a reliable final database state.

1. **Definition of View Serializability:**
   - View serializability is a correctness criterion for concurrent transactions that ensures that the final result or "view" of the database is the same as if the transactions had been executed in some serial order.
   - Unlike conflict serializability, which focuses on conflicts between read and write operations, view serializability considers the overall effect of transactions on the database.

2. **Conditions for View Serializability:**
   - View serializability is determined based on three conditions:  

     - **Initial Read:** If a transaction $T_i$ reads the initial value of a data item $Q$ in one schedule, then $T_i$ must also read the initial value of $Q$ in any other schedule that is view equivalent.
     - **Read-Write Pair:** If $T_i$ reads a data item $Q$ produced by another transaction $T_j$ in one schedule, then $T_i$ must also read the value of $Q$ produced by $T_j$ in any other schedule that is view equivalent. There should be no conflicting writes between the read and the write.
     - **Final Write:** The transaction that performs the final write operation on a data item must be the same in all view equivalent schedules.

3. **Blind Writes and Blind Reads:**
   - Blind writes occur when a transaction writes to a data item without having previously read its value. This can happen in schedules that are view serializable but not conflict serializable.
   - Blind reads occur when a transaction reads a value without caring about the producing transaction. Blind reads are generally allowed in view serializability.

4. **Relation to Conflict Serializability:**
   - Any schedule that is conflict serializable is also view serializable. However, the reverse is not necessarily true. There exist schedules that are view serializable but not conflict serializable.  
   - A schedule is view serializable if it is view equivalent to serial schedule and View equivalence is purely based on reads and writes alone.

5. **Testing for View Serializability:**
   - Unlike conflict serializability, determining view serializability is computationally challenging, and there is no known efficient algorithm for general cases. As a result, practical methods involve checking for sufficient conditions rather than providing a definitive test.
